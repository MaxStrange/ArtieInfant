## Minutetrim

Currently:

[Segment list] -> [[one minute long segment, one minute long segment, etc. leftover], [etc.]]
Where each sublist is an original segment, split up into one minute long segments.

Should be:

[Segment list] -> [one minute long segment, one minute long segment, etc. ... leftover]
Only one leftover at the very end, and the list should be flat.

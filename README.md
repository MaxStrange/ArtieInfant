This is the deliverable for my Master's thesis at the University of Washington, Bothell.
Most of the folders in here are for development purposes.

The license is MIT, so go ahead and do whatever you want! Just make sure you give me credit (mostly because I don't want you to be dishonest, not because I care about the credit :P).

*This is very much under construction*, but the target for release is Q2 2019.

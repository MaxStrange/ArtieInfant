# ArtieInfant
Robot Operating System Simulated Infant

This is the deliverable for my Master's thesis at the University of Washington, Bothell.
The actual deliverable will be contained in the ros folder. The other folders are there for development purposes.

## License
The license is MIT, so go ahead and do whatever you want! Just make sure you give me credit (mostly because I don't want you to be dishonest, not because I care about the credit :P).

*This is very much under construction*, but the target for release is Q4 2018.
